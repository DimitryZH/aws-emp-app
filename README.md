# AWS Employee Directory App

## Overview

The AWS Employee Directory App is designed to showcase the use of various AWS services. It allows users to manage employee data, including adding, updating, and deleting records. The app leverages AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS IAM to provide a scalable and secure solution.

## Features

- **Employee Management**: Add, update, and delete employee records.
- **Scalability**: Utilizes Amazon EC2 for scalable compute resources.
- **Storage**: Stores employee data in Amazon DynamoDB.
- **Security**: Implements AWS IAM for secure access control.
- **File Storage**: Uses Amazon S3 for storing employee-related files.

## Architecture

The application is built using a multi-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend**: A web interface for interacting with the employee directory.
2. **Backend**: A RESTful API built with AWS services to handle business logic and data processing.
3. **Database**: Amazon DynamoDB for storing employee data.
4. **File Storage**: Amazon S3 for storing files such as employee photos.
